# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.4.0]

### RISC-V 64

- [**breaking**] Change CSR operand order to match RISC-V assembly
- Add support to system reset a core
- Reset registers that require initialization in Core::reset
- Add helper functions for registers index manimulation
- Add `bv` as shorthand for `BitVector::new`
- Att `set_csr` to directly write CSRs
- Add `dispatch_interrupt` to `Core`
- [**breaking**] `get_csr` and `read_csr` return options instead of panicking

### Compiler

- Generate register initialization functions
- Add support for array initialization
- Generate a new `_reset_all_registers` function
